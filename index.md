title: Changkat Primary School
description: Changkat Primary School was initially named Changkat Changi Primary
  School because of its location. It was built on the top of a small hill
  (“changkat” means small hill in Malay) at Changi Road.  In 1988, the school
  moved to the present premises and was renamed Changkat Primary School. In
  2002, the school was scheduled for upgrading under PRIME. The school thus
  shifted to No.7, Jalan Tiga Ratus and occupied the old school premises. In
  June 2004, Changkat Primary moved back to its present premises at Simei Street
  3.

<h3>Mathematics Classroom Experience</h3>
<p>Step into the evolution of math learning in our Then and Now Classroom!
This interactive experience lets participants explore how math education
has changed over time.</p>
<p>🔹 'Then' Classroom: Experience traditional learning with chalkboards,
OHP, and paper notebooks. Engage in memorizing and reciting multiplication
tables, solving mental sums on paper, and interacting with a setup of wooden
tables and chairs for an immersive throwback.</p>
<p>🔹 'Now' Classroom: Discover modern methods using mini-whiteboards, iPads,
and manipulatives. Learn concepts like equal sets and repeated addition
with hands-on materials, and solve problems digitally. There will be an
interaction booth showcases real-life classroom moments through posters
of students in action.</p>
<p>Join us in this unique journey to see how math teaching has transformed
over the years!</p>

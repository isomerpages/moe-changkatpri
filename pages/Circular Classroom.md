<p>The Changkat Primary School PIE Club has a proud history of fostering
strong partnerships between parents, teachers, and the community to support
student learning and school-wide initiatives.</p>
<p>From a small group of dedicated parents, the PIE Club has grown into an
active community partner—organising events like the Mid-Autumn Festival,
hosting parenting talks such as Heartfelt Connections through the 5 Love
Languages, and collaborating with social enterprise like The Circular Classroom
to create memorabilia for the school’s 60th Anniversary.</p>
<p>As part of its ongoing growth and collaboration efforts, the PIE Club
also partnered with PSGs across Singapore through the Go Green PSGs initiative,
contributing to a nationwide artwork made from pre-loved school uniforms
to promote sustainability.</p>

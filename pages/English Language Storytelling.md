<p>Since the past, our teachers have brought stories to life using Big Books,
gathering students around them for memorable shared reading experiences.
This timeless method has proven so successful in nurturing a love for reading,
language, and learning that it remains widely practised in our classrooms
today.</p>
<p>Now, we invite you to relive the magic! Step into our storytelling corner
and join us as we recreate a lively, heartwarming lesson through a beloved
book about team spirit — where every page sparks imagination, friendship,
and fun.</p>
<p>📖 Storytelling sessions begin at 9:30 a.m. and run every 30 minutes.
Come, sit back, and let the story sweep you away!</p>

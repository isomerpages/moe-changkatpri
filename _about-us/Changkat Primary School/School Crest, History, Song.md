Changkat Primary School was initially named Changkat Changi Primary School because of its location. It was built on the top of a small hill ("changkat" means small hill in Malay) at Changi Road.

In 1988, the school moved to the present premises and was renamed Changkat Primary School. In 2002, the school was scheduled for upgrading under PRIME. The school thus shifted to No.7, Jalan Tiga Ratus and occupied the old school premises. In June 2004, Changkat Primary moved back to its present premises at Simei Street 3.

The school academic performance has been steadily progressing over the years. It has also seen success in the non-academic areas such as Sports and Games, Aesthetics and Information Communication Technology (ICT).

There is a steady demand for more places in the school from the surrounding neighbourhood in the past few years. With a pleasant and conducive teaching-learning environment and a committed and dedicated staff, the school is set to surge forward to achieve greater heights in both the academic and non-academic fields.

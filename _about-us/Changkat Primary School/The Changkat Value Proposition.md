### The Changkat Value Proposition

As the only primary school in the Changi-Simei constituency, Changkat Primary is well regarded by parents for its provision of an all-round, student-centric and values-driven education. The numerous school and student achievements in areas such as Sports and Games, and Performing Arts as well as positive outcomes in the Quality of School Experience Survey administered to graduating classes in the last few years, speak volumes about the good work put in by the school staff to provide our pupils with a quality school experience.

Pupils who study in Changkat Primary will enjoy a unique school experience through the provision of the following:

|  | Details | Remarks |
|---|---|---|
| ted Instruction as a design philosophy with Cooperative Learning as the school-wide pedagogy | Differentiated Instruction (DI) is adopted as a philosophy in the school’s curricular and co-curricular designs.<br>Cooperative Learning is the school-wide pedagogy that has been identified to support DI .<br>ICT is leveraged on as a tool to enable Self-Directed and Collaborative Learning . ICT also serves as a tool to enrich pupils’ learning experience.<br>Embedded within the learning process is the use of in-Class Formative Assessment strategies that allow teachers to gather information about student learning in real-time so as to make timely adjustments to teaching and be more responsive to learner needs. | Core Curriculum covers the academic subjects such as the languages whereas Co-curriculum covers the non-academic subjects such as Physical Education , Character and Student Leadership development.<br>Cooperative Learning emphasizes on interdependent learning.<br>An example where ICT is used to enrich the learning experience involves the use of Apps such as Padlet, which, when used with the Cooperative Learning Strategy, “Think-Pair-Share”, builds up pupil confidence and ability to give better quality responses to questions posed by Teachers.<br>Examples of in-Class Formative Assessment strategies include “Thumbs Up/Down” and use of “Exit Cards”.   |
| Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) programme | The key foci of the school’s Character Development framework comprise personal and social development, leadership development and, community and citizenry.<br>Changkat’s PRIDE Award recognizes the everyday efforts of pupils who demonstrate the school values.  PRIDE dovetails into the annual ECHA (Edusave Character Award) in which pupils who demonstrate exemplary character, are recognized during the annual prize giving ceremony. <br>CKPSA* programme provides pupils with a platform to share their views and ideas. Each term, pupils pen appreciation notes to different groups of people. They also offer suggestions in response to problems/concerns posed by the CCE department.<br>The school’s Motivational Programme forms part of the repertoire of key strategies to build Teacher-Student Relationship (TSR) and serves to deepen pupils’ sense of belonging, first to the class, and then to the school. | Behavioral indicators for school values, namely, Patriotism, Resilience, Integrity, Discipline and Empathy , make explicit the learning outcomes to the pupils.  <br>There is a structured approach to developing student leadership . All pupils are provided with the opportunity to take up at least one leadership role each year.  <br>Under the CKPSA* programme, the best Appreciation Note and Suggestion from each level is read out at assembly to the rest of the pupils.  <br>TSR building is a cornerstone in the school’s work on student centricity. A trusting and warm Teacher-Student relationship will allow teachers to better support the children’s developmental and learning needs. The school also believes that a strong TSR translates to high student motivation and morale which in turn translates to positive outcomes in the academic and non-academic arenas. |
|  <br>4 Overseas Learning Journeys | <br><br>Cultural Immersion trips to China and Malaysia<br>Student Leaders Exchange Programme<br>CCA Exchange<br><br> <br>  | The Overseas Learning Journeys target Pr 5 pupils and have the following broad objectives:<br><br>Develop in our pupils the 21CC of global awareness and cross-cultural skills and sensitivities;<br>Expose pupils to Asia and the world and sensitise them to the place of Singapore in the world; and<br>Deepen pupils’ commitment and rootedness to Singapore  <br>Selection of pupils is based on pupils demonstrating desirable work attitude and behavior in school. With 4 trips each year, at least 60% in each cohort get an opportunity to go on an overseas learning journey as compared to MOE’s target of at least 15% of each primary school cohort |
| Modular Co-Curricular Activities (MCCA Pr 3-6) and Programme for Active Learning (PAL Pr 1-2) | MCCA and PAL are enrichment activities that supplement Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) . MCCA is offered to all pupils from Pr 3 to 6 while PAL is offered to all pupils from Pr 1 and 2.<br>Activities for MCCA and PAL span 3 domains, namely Sports and Games, Outdoor Education and the Aesthetics.   | MCCA and PAL take place during school hours. In particular, activities that are not offered under CCA may be offered during MCCA and PAL. This in effect enlarges the range of activities that pupils get to experience during their primary school education with Changkat Pr.  <br>Examples of enrichment activities include Rock Climbing and Hip Hop Dancing. |
| Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) | On offer are activities from 3 clusters, namely Sports and Games, Visual and Performing Arts, and Clubs/Societies. The school’s niche CCA is basketball. The core CCAs comprise of Track and Field, Wushu, Dance, Choir and Guzheng. The rest of the CCAs are recreational in nature. | The niche and core CCAs have both the excellence and recreational arms.

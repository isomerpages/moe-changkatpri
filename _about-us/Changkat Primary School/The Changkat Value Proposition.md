### The Changkat Value Proposition

As the only primary school in the Changi-Simei constituency, Changkat Primary is well regarded by parents for its provision of an all-round, student-centric and values-driven education. The numerous school and student achievements in areas such as Sports and Games, and Performing Arts as well as positive outcomes in the Quality of School Experience Survey administered to graduating classes in the last few years, speak volumes about the good work put in by the school staff to provide our pupils with a quality school experience.

Pupils who study in Changkat Primary will enjoy a unique school experience through the provision of the following:

**Differentiated Instruction as a design philosophy with Cooperative Learning as the school-wide pedagogy**

| Details | Remarks |
|---|---|
| **Differentiated Instruction (DI)** is adopted as a philosophy in the school’s curricular and co-curricular designs. <br> <br> **Cooperative Learning** is the school-wide pedagogy that has been identified to support **DI**  <br> <br> **ICT** is leveraged on as a tool to enable **Self-Directed** and **Collaborative Learning** . ICT also serves as a tool to enrich pupils’ learning experience.<br> <br>Embedded within the learning process is the use of in-Class **Formative Assessment** strategies that allow teachers to gather information about student learning in real-time so as to make timely adjustments to teaching and be more responsive to learner needs. | Core Curriculum covers the academic subjects such as the languages whereas Co-curriculum covers the non-academic subjects such as Physical Education , Character and Student Leadership development. <br> <br> **Cooperative Learning** emphasizes on interdependent learning. <br> <br> An example where ICT is used to enrich the learning experience involves the use of Apps such as Padlet, which, when used with the **Cooperative Learning** Strategy, “Think-Pair-Share”, builds up pupil confidence and ability to give better quality responses to questions posed by Teachers. <br> <br> Examples of in-Class **Formative Assessment** strategies include “Thumbs Up/Down” and use of “Exit Cards”. |

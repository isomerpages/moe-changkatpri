#### **Handphone Usage by Students**
Students are allowed to bring handphones only with written permission from the school. Parents must fill in a prescribed form for this purpose.

We would like to share some guidelines pertaining to the usage of handphones in school. These guidelines are meant to ensure that students are focused during lesson time and not be distracted sms-ing or playing with phone functions.

#### **Guidelines on Handphones**
*   Handphones must be switched off and should be in student’s pocket at all times. Calls, if any, can only be made at the guardhouse and beyond (outside school premises).&nbsp;
*   Handphones must be handed over to the teacher during PE lessons for safe keeping.

Students who are found to have breached the guidelines will have their handphones confiscated by the teachers and Parents/Guardians informed. Parents/Guardians will be required to personally collect the handphones from the school’s Operation Manager (OM).&nbsp;Please note also that the school shall not be held responsible for any loss of or damage to the children’s&nbsp; handphones. Students must&nbsp;be responsible&nbsp;for the care of their handphones.

Parents/ Guardians of students who are bringing handphones to school are required to complete the acknowledgement slip (Acknowledgement Form - Handphone Policy) found in our school website in the ‘Parents &amp; Students’ tab in ‘Forms’. Please give this acknowledgement slip to the class form teachers.

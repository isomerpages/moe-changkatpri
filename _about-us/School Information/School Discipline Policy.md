### School Discipline Policy

We would like to share that the School Discipline Policy has been reviewed and updated this year. The types of offences and their description are as outlined in the table below. Students who have broken the school rules will be dealt with accordingly. Depending on the frequency and severity of the offence(s), the following actions may be taken:

1.  Verbal Warning
2.  Counselling
3.  Detention
4.  Compensation
5.  Lesson/Class Suspension
6.  Corrective Work Order

You may also like to note that all offences will be recorded and the school reserves the right to decide on the best possible consequence for each offence committed.

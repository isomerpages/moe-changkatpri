### Dress Code

School Attire And Dress Code <br>
Wearing Our School Uniform with Pride

The way we wear our uniform reflects our pride and attitude and is also a projection of our image to the public. Our dress code sets the standard for our attire and guides us to uphold the good name of the school. The focus is on being neat and clean at all times.

##### Uniform
1.All students must be properly attired at all times in school. Students are to wear the prescribed school uniform. Modification to the uniform is not allowed.

3.Students must have their names and class sewn or written using waterproof markers on the tabs found on the inner side of the shirt/blouse collar and skirts/shorts waistband. This is for easy identification in case any student misplaces these personal items.

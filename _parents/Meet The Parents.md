### Meet The Parents 2022

#### Follow-up on Meet-the-Parents (MTP) Session 
In order for parents/guardians to better understand our school and level programmes and expectations, the school would like to urge all parents/guardians to set aside time this week to go through the information in the Meet-the-Parents (MTP) slides on your own carefully and familiarize yourselves with the content. Should you have any queries, please feel free to contact your child/ward’s Form Teachers and clarify any doubts with the teachers.

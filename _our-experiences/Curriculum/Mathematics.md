<h3><strong>Mathematics</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Vision:</strong>
<br>Every pupil, a logical thinker and an analytical problem solver, with
a lifelong interest and love for Mathematics.
<br>
<br><strong>Mission:</strong>
<br>To develop the lifelong interest and love for Mathematics which allows
pupils to discover the meaning in learning Mathematics by engaging pupils
in activities which develop their ability to reason logically and to communicate
mathematically.</p>

<p>At Changkat Primary, our teaching focuses on <strong>deep understanding, problem solving, and confidence in mathematics</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Key Features:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Concrete → Pictorial → Abstract:</strong> Students start with hands-on
activities, move to visual models, and then to abstract equations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Problem Solving &amp; Bar Modeling:</strong> Encourages logical
thinking and strategies for tackling real-world problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mastery &amp; Spiral Learning:</strong> Topics are taught in depth
and revisited progressively for long-term understanding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mathematical Discourse:</strong> Students explain their reasoning
clearly, building confidence and clarity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With Singapore Math, our students develop solid foundations, critical
thinking skills, and a love for learning mathematics.</p>
<h4><strong>Key Programmes</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Weekend Revision Programme (WRP)</strong>
</p>
<p>The Weekend Revision Programme (WRP) is designed to provide students with
additional reinforcement and practice for previously taught topics and
concepts. It also offers opportunities for students to apply mathematical
concepts in problem-solving scenarios.</p>
<p>Programme Content:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Primary 1 to Primary 3: Focus on basic to higher-order questions based
on topics already covered in class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Primary 4: Booklet A and Booklet B exercises.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Primary 5 and Primary 6: Paper 1 and Paper 2 practice.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Heuristics in Mathematics</strong>
</p>
<p>Equipping pupils with skills and heuristics for mathematical problem-solving
is fundamental to their learning of Mathematics. To support this, the Mathematics
Department has developed a Heuristic Package for Primary 1 to Primary 6.
This package systematically guides pupils in mastering different problem-solving
heuristics and the use of model drawing, enabling them to approach mathematical
problems confidently and effectively.</p>
<p><strong>LSM and ICAN</strong>
<br>This programme equips pupils with foundational numeracy and literacy skills,
boosting their confidence in mathematical problem-solving.</p>
<p><strong>Pi Day</strong>
<br>Pi Day is celebrated annually on 14th March, representing the first three
digits of the mathematical constant π (3.14). To spark students’ interest
and curiosity in Mathematics, pupils engage in fun and interactive activities
designed to explore and learn more about pi.</p>

<p><strong>Super Mathematician Task Cards</strong>
<br>The Super Mathematician Task Cards provide opportunities for students
to apply Math in everyday life, promoting a joy of learning. Primary 1
to Primary 4 students receive task sheets during the June Holidays to complete
a series of challenges with their family members. Students who earn 10
stars will be awarded a <strong>Super Mathematician Badge</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Lower Primary Shopping Experience</strong>
<br>In this mock-up shopping experience, Primary 1 and Primary 2 students
are encouraged to explore and ask questions naturally through authentic,
real-life problem solving. They take on the roles of customers and sellers
and the shopping experience promotes exploration and questioning through
role-play, decision-making, and interaction, helping students connect mathematical
concepts (like money, arithmetic, and budgeting) with real-life experiences.
It nurtures inquiry, collaboration, and critical thinking — key 21st-century
skills.</p>

<p><strong>E2K Mathematics Programme</strong>
<br>The E2K Mathematics Programme is an enrichment initiative for selected
Primary 4 and Primary 5 pupils, conducted by our teachers. It aims to develop
pupils’ mathematical reasoning skills and deepen their conceptual understanding
through an inquiry-based approach. Pupils collaborate with peers and engage
in mathematical thinking using specially designed resources such as puzzles,
games, and explorations tailored for the programme.</p>
<p><strong>External Competitions</strong>
<br>Pupils also have opportunities to participate in various external Mathematics
competitions organized by other schools, such as:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>NUS High NMOS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RMO organized by Raffles Institution</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SMOPS organized by Hwa Chong</p>
</li>
</ul>

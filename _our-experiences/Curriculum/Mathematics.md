<p><strong>Vision:</strong>
<br>Every pupil, a logical thinker and an analytical problem solver, with
a lifelong interest and love for Mathematics.
<br>
<br><strong>Mission:</strong>
<br>To develop the lifelong interest and love for Mathematics which allows
pupils to discover the meaning in learning Mathematics by engaging pupils
in activities which develop their ability to reason logically and to communicate
mathematically.</p>
<h4><strong>Programmes:</strong></h4>
<h5>Weekend Revision Programme (WRP)</h5>
<p>The Weekend Revision Programme (WRP) aims to provide more reinforcement
and practice for the topics/concepts taught previously. It also aims to
provide opportunities for students to apply Math concepts to problem-solving.
The followings are the main content for WRP:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>P1 to P3 – basic to higher order questions based on topics the students
have learnt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>P4 to P6 - Booklet A and B (P4) and Paper 1 and paper 2 (P5&amp;6).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>Heuristics Package</h5>
<p>Equipping pupils with the skills and heuristics for mathematical problem-solving
is fundamental to the learning of Mathematics. The Mathematics Department
has designed a Heuristic Package for P1 to P6 that will systematically
enable the pupils to be equipped with the different Mathematics heuristics
and model drawing for problem-solving.</p>
<h4><strong>Enrichment And Support Programmes</strong></h4>
<h5>E2K</h5>
<p>The E2K Mathematics Programme is a Mathematics enrichment for selected
Primary 4 and 5 pupils conducted by our teachers. It aims to develop in
pupils mathematical reasoning skills and deepen their conceptual understanding
through an inquiry approach which allows them to collaborate with their
peers and engage in mathematical thinking through resources such as puzzles,
games and mathematics explorations which are specially designed for the
programme.</p>
<h5>External Competitions</h5>
<p>Pupils have the opportunities to take part in various Math competitions
organized by other schools such as NUS High NMOS, RIPMWC organized by Raffles
Institution, SMOPS organized by Hwa Chong etc.</p>
<h5>LSM and ICAN</h5>
<p>This programme equips the pupils with the basic numeracy and literacy
skills, thereby boosting their confidence in Mathematics problem solving.</p>
<h5>Pi Day</h5>
<p>Pi Day is a day to celebrate the mathematical constant π [pi]. It is observed
on 14th March annually as the date represents the first three digits [3.14]
of pi. In order to ignite students’ interest and curiosity in Mathematics,
students will participate in activities related to Pi Day to discover more
about pi. Activity booths were set up at the foyer during recess in term
3 week 10.

<h5>Super Mathematician Task cards</h5>
<p>The Super Mathematician Task cards aim to provide opportunities for students
to apply Math to their daily life and in turn, promote joy of learning
in Math. P1 to P4 students are given the task sheet during June Holiday
to complete a series of tasks together with their family members. Upon
completing 10 stars, students will receive a Super Mathematician Badge.</p>

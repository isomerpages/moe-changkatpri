#### **Programmes**
##### **School-Based Reading Programme (P1-P6)**
Reading is a fulfilling, and nourishing experience for students as their young minds capture and grasp information very easily. That is why we strive to cultivate the habit of reading among our students. Students who are avid readers of Mother Tongue language books, usually acquire strong vocabulary in their MT and are able to write creatively. The school provides our students access to books of different genres. In the classroom, guided reading, role-play and many other activities are conducted to encourage students to read books in their Mother Tongue Languages. The school aims to inculcate in students the love in reading MT books.

##### **Mother Tongue Language and Cultural Camp (P3)**
This is a level based programme that aims to provide an immersive environment for students to learn and use their Mother Tongue Language and to appreciate one’s own mother tongue language culture through hands-on activities. This programme will provide students an opportunity to use their Mother Tongue in an authentic environment.

##### **Mother Tongue Languages Fortnight (P1-P6)**
The MTL Fortnight is an initiative started by MOE. The MTL Fortnight activities provide platforms for students to actively learn MTL and the associated culture to experience MTL as ‘a living language’. The activities provide authentic opportunities for students to use MTL and experience the culture. During the 2 weeks, the school organizes a series of targeted, age appropriate activities for different groups or levels. These activities include cultural games, quizzes, hands-on cultural experiences (for example, Traditional Arts and Games, Chinese Fan/Batik Painting, Cultural Performances, Theatre experience, Learning Journeys and more.)

This programme is conducted in Semester 2 Term 3, over two consecutive weeks.

##### **Conversational Chinese / Malay Language for P3 pupils**
The Conversational Chinese/Malay Programme (CCM) was introduced as an enrichment programme for non-Chinese/non-Malay students who are interested in learning a 3rd language and its culture. Learning Conversational Chinese/Malay would facilitate these students to communicate with their counterparts, to better understand and appreciate Chinese/Malay culture and values. It will also help students enhance their rapport with friends of the other race. Feedback from students shows that they enjoyed the class and hope to continue learning the third language when they graduate to a secondary school.

##### **Overseas Immersion Programme (For selected P5 students)**
The overseas Immersion Programme is to develop in students the 21st Century Competencies of global awareness and cross-cultural skills and sensitivities and to expose these students to Asia and the world and sensitize them to Singapore’s place in the world. We also hope to help students cultivate skills and values such as self-reliance, independence, bonding with fellow schoolmates and foster team camaraderie through their participation in this programme.  This programme will resume when the situation returns to normalcy.

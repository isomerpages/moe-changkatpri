<h2>MOE Sexuality Education in schools</h2>
<p>1 - Sexuality Education (SEd) in schools is about enabling students to
understand the physiological, social and emotional changes they experience
as they mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships including those
with members of the opposite sex, make wise, informed and responsible decisions
on sexuality matters as well as keeping themselves safe when online. SEd
is premised on the importance of the family as the basic unit of society.
This means encouraging healthy, heterosexual marriages and stable nuclear
family units with extended family support. The teaching and learning of
SEd is based on respect for the values and beliefs of the different ethnic
and religious communities in Singapore on sexuality issues.</p>
<p>2 - The&nbsp;<strong>Goals</strong>&nbsp;of Sexuality Education are:
<br>a. To help students make wise, responsible and informed decisions through
the provision of accurate, current and age-appropriate&nbsp;knowledge&nbsp;on
human sexuality and the consequences of sexual activity;
<br>b. To help students know themselves and build healthy and rewarding relationships
through the acquisition of&nbsp;social and emotional skills&nbsp;of self-awareness,
management of their thoughts, feelings and behaviours, development of empathy
for others, possession of effective communication, problem-solving and
decision-making skills; and
<br>c. To help students develop a moral compass, respect for themselves and
for others as sexual beings, premised on the family as the basic unit of
society, through the inculcation of&nbsp;positive mainstream values and
attitudes&nbsp;about sexuality.</p>
<p>3 - The&nbsp;<strong>Key Messages</strong>&nbsp;of Sexuality Education
are:
<br>a. Love and respect yourself as you love and respect others;
<br>b. Build positive relationships based on love and respect (which are the
foundation for strong families);
<br>c. Make responsible decisions for yourself, your family and society; and
<br>d. Abstinence before marriage is the best protection against STIs/HIV
and unintended pregnancies. Casual sex can harm and hurt you and your loved
ones.</p>

<p><strong>OVERVIEW OF CHANGKAT PRIMARY SCHOOL'S SEXUALITY EDUCATION PROGRAMME FOR 2025</strong>
</p>
<p>4 - Sexuality Education is delivered in a holistic manner through the
school curriculum.&nbsp;The content for Sexuality Education is grouped
into five main themes: Human Development, Interpersonal Relationships,

more information on the scope of Sexuality Education in the school curriculum.</p>
<p>5 - The subjects that incorporate topics on sexuality include:
<br>a. Science
<br>b. Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)</p>
<p><strong>Sexuality Education Lessons</strong>:</p>
<p>6 - The upper primary years mark the onset of puberty. With better nutrition
and improved health care, children are reaching puberty at a younger age
and have to grapple with physical, emotional and psychological changes
in themselves. The implication is that our children are becoming biologically
ready for sexual activity sooner without necessarily having the corresponding
cognitive or emotional maturity to modulate their behaviours. Furthermore,
our young are also exposed to a wide range of influences that could endanger
health and undermine the integrity of the family. Our students require
guidance so that they can respond with discernment to the sexual messages
in the media and other sources.</p>
<p>7 - Sexuality Education (SEd) lessons are taught as part of CCE (FTGP)
at Primary 5 and 6. Through these lessons, students will learn healthy
ways to manage the physiological, social and emotional changes in their
growing years. They learn to build healthy and rewarding relationships
with others, including those with members of the opposite sex. Students
are also guided to make wise, informed and responsible decisions to keep
themselves safe from sexuality-related risks.</p>

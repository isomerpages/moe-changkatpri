### **Science**
#### **Vision:**
Curious Minds, Custodians of the Environment.

#### **Mission:**
To instill joy in learning Science and bring out the curious and explorative instincts in every child by providing an enriching science experience for all students to develop inquiring minds through inquiry, discovery, exploration, information-communication technologies and collaboration

With the emphasis on a student-centred approach, the teaching and learning of Science at Changkat Primary School focuses on the importance of providing authentic contexts for pupils to apply their learning. During lessons, we explore how science is interwoven in our daily lives to make the learning of Science more meaningful and sustainable.  This is done through programmes which cater to the different needs and learning styles of the pupils.

#### **Science Programmes @ Changkat Primary:**
##### **(a) Inquiry Based Approach**
Guided by the 5Es in the Inquiry-based Learning approach, pupils discover science concepts through hands-on experience and discovery learning. Lesson packages for all levels (P3 to P6) are differentiated according to pupils’ readiness.

Teaching Science through inquiry leverages on the use of ICT to promote SDL and CoL to bring about engaged learning. For example, blogging is commonly used as a platform for pupils to engage in discussions and presenting information. Formative assessment tools (e.g. exit cards, LGIs) are seamlessly integrated to provide an on-going assessment of pupils’ understanding & application of concepts.

#### **(b) Outdoor Experiential Learning**
At Changkat Primary, pupils are given the opportunity to experience the concepts taught through outdoor experiential learning. Physical Science stations can be found around the school and lessons are conducted there. Students are also able to experience and take care of caterpillars and butterflies at our Butterfly Trail.

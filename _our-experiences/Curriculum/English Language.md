<h3><strong>English Language</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Mission</strong></h4>
<p>Developing students to be empathetic communicators, discerning readers
and creative inquirers</p>
<h4><strong>Description of Programmes</strong></h4>
<h5><strong>Stellar @ Changkat</strong></h5>
<p>A typical English language classroom at both the lower and middle primaries
is filled with bursts of colours from classrooms displays, mostly handiworks
of our enthusiastic language learners and of thoughtful chatter of the
pupils. The vibrancy in colours and of the pupils’ conversations is mainly
due to the implementation of STELLAR.</p>
<p>STELLAR, which stands for Strategies for Teaching English Language Learning
and Reading, aims to:
<br>a) strengthen language and reading skills and
<br>b) promote a positive attitude towards reading in the foundational years
through the use of well-established, learner-centred and developmentally
appropriate pedagogical approaches using authentic children's literature.</p>

<h5><strong>Writing, Reading &amp; Oral Communication</strong></h5>
<p>We believe in equipping our language learners with a host of strategies
to tackle various components of the English Language.</p>

<p>Our writing packages, which begin with the Middle Primary (P3 &amp; P4)
through to the Upper Primary (P5 &amp; P6), teach pupils to write using
an array of skills to connect with the readers. Strategies are taught in
equipping our pupils with the skills to plan&nbsp;their story, work on
plot development and strengthen the use of language skills when creating
a masterpiece. At the Lower Primary (P1 &amp; P2), the pupils learn to
put magic into their writing through a simpler structure.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many reading strategies when it comes to interacting with a
text. In CKPS, pupils are taught to be more deliberate readers; one who
is able to connect with the text, the world and self. They do so through
effective reading comprehension skills like annotation. Pupils learn to
stop to ask questions as they read texts so as to glean a better understanding
of what the author is putting across. This in turn aids pupils in answering
comprehension questions better. In tackling the Oral Communication component,
pupils use the EEC strategy in order to Express, Elaborate and Conclude
a given stimulus presented in Stimulus-based Conversation component.</p>

<h5><strong>Differentiated Instruction, Formative Assessment &amp; Cooperative Learning</strong></h5>
<p>Our teachers engage the pupils through the use DI, FA and CL to customise
the pupils’ learning experience. Pupils are often grouped flexibly to suit
the learning intentions of the lesson. CL structures such as Jigsaw, Numbered
Heads Together, Rally Robin and Round Robin are commonplace in our classrooms
as are FA tools such as white boarding, use of exit cards or use of thumbs
up-down during lessons.</p>
<h5><strong>CKPS Whole School Reading Plan</strong></h5>
<p>We work hand in hand with the National Library Board (NLB) and our Parent
Support Group (PIE Club – Partners in Education Club) in ensuring that
various groups of pupils are supported in our efforts to promote a Reading
Culture in Changkat.</p>

<h3><strong>English Language</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Mission</strong></h4>
<p>Developing students to be empathetic communicators, discerning readers
and creative inquirers</p>
<h4><strong>Description of Programmes</strong></h4>
<h5><strong>STELLAR @ Changkat</strong></h5>
<p>A typical English language classroom at both the Lower and Middle Primary
is filled with bursts of colours from classrooms displays – mostly handiworks
of our enthusiastic language learners – and of thoughtful chatter of the
students . The vibrancy in colours and of the students’ conversations is
mainly due to the implementation of STELLAR.</p>
<p>STELLAR, which stands for Strategies for Teaching English Language Learning
and Reading, aims to:</p>
<p>a. strengthen language and reading skills; and</p>
<p>b. promote a positive attitude towards reading in the foundational years
through the use of well-established, learner-centred and developmentally
appropriate pedagogical approaches using authentic children’s literature</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h5><strong>Writing, Reading &amp; Oral Communication</strong></h5>
<p>We believe in equipping our language learners with a host of strategies
to tackle various components of the English Language.</p>

<p>Our writing packages, which begin in the Middle Primary (P3 &amp; P4)
through to the Upper Primary (P5 &amp; P6), teach students to write using
an array of skills to connect with their readers. Strategies are taught
to equip our students with the skills to plan their story, work on plot
development and strengthen the use of language skills when creating a masterpiece.
At the Lower Primary (P1 &amp; P2), the students learn to put magic into
their writing through a simpler structure.</p>
<p>There are many reading strategies when it comes to interacting with a
text. In CKPS, students are taught to be more deliberate readers – one
who is able to connect with the text, the world and self. They do so through
effective reading comprehension skills such as annotation. Students learn
to stop to ask questions as they read texts so as to glean a better understanding
of what the author is putting across. In oral communication, students use
the EEC (Express, Elaborate and Conclude) strategy to communicate their
ideas wholly and clearly.</p>

<h5><strong>CKPS Whole School Reading Plan</strong></h5>
<p>As part of our efforts to promote a reading culture in the school, we
work hand in hand with the National Library Board (NLB) and our Parent
Support Group (PIE Club – Partners in Education Club) in ensuring that
various groups of students are supported in developing a love for reading.</p>
<p></p>
<h5><strong>Differentiated Instruction, Formative Assessment &amp; Cooperative Learning</strong></h5>
<p>Our teachers engage the students through the use differentiated instruction
to customise the students’ learning experience. Students are often grouped
flexibly to suit the learning intentions of the lesson. Cooperative learning
structures such as Jigsaw, Numbered Heads Together, Rally Robin and Round
Robin are commonplace in our classroom, as are formative assessment tools
such as white boarding, exit cards and the use of thumbs up-down during
lessons.</p>

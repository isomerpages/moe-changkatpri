The PE Department is guided by the 3E framework of **_‘Educate, Experience & Excel’_**. At the level of “Educate and Experience”, the school plans for mass participation in PE during curricular hours for students to learn new sports and build skills.  At the level of “Excel”, students are exposed to various competitions such as the Intra-Class Games, Inter-Class Games as well as the Sports Carnival.

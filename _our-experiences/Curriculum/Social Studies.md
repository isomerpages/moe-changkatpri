<h3><strong>SOCIAL STUDIES</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Mission</strong>
</p>
<p>At the heart of the Singapore Social Studies Curriculum (refer to Figure
1) is the preparation of our students to be effective citizens by helping
them to better understand the interconnectedness of Singapore and the world
they live in, and appreciate the complexities of the human experience.</p>

<p>The aim of Social Studies is to help pupils grow in <strong>knowledge</strong>, <strong>skills</strong> and <strong>values</strong> by
examining issues that matter to our society and the world.</p>
<p><strong>Pedagogical Approach &amp; Assessment</strong>
</p>
<p>The syllabus emphasises <strong>inquiry-based learning</strong> — students
explore guiding questions, examine multiple perspectives, and engage in
authentic tasks. Assessment includes <strong>performance tasks</strong> (group
work and individual reflection), as well as regular evaluation of understanding
for Primary 3 to 6.</p>

<p>Figure 4.1 from the syllabus shows the framework of the Humanities Inquiry
Approach.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Students are also engaged in <strong>interactive lessons and projects</strong> that
are based on scenarios to deepen their real-world learning. These projects
allow students to apply their knowledge, skills, and values in authentic
contexts, reinforcing meaningful connections to the subject.</p>

<p>Learning includes <strong>field-based experiences / learning journeys</strong> to
help students connect classroom learning with real-life contexts. This
approach deepens understanding, sustains interest, and encourages inquiry.</p>

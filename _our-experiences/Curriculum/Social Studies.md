<p><strong>SOCIAL STUDIES</strong>
</p>
<p>The Singapore Social Studies curriculum prepares students to be informed,
concerned, and participative citizens.</p>
<p>By exploring real-world issues through inquiry and authentic learning,
students develop critical thinking skills, appreciate diverse perspectives,
and understand Singapore’s interconnectedness with the world. Social Studies
also nurtures values that inspire empathy, social responsibility, and active
contribution to society.</p>
<p><strong>Inquiry-Based Learning in Social Studies</strong>
</p>
<p>Each primary level is guided by an inquiry focus question, with supporting
guiding questions that deepen understanding, encourage inquiry, and inspire
social action.</p>
<p>Students’ learning is further enriched through Cohort Learning Journeys
to locations such as the Asian Civilisations Museum, Indian Heritage Centre,
Kreta Ayer Heritage Gallery and Geylang Serai Heritage Gallery. These Learning
Journeys provide students with real-world experiences, helping them explore
concepts through hands-on, multi-sensory activities. This approach deepens
understanding, sustains interest, and encourages inquiry.</p>
<p>Students are also engaged in engaging and interactive lessons and projects
that are based on scenarios to deepen their real-world learning. These
projects allow students to apply their knowledge, skills, and values in
authentic contexts, reinforcing meaningful connections to the subject.</p>
<p>Beyond acquiring knowledge, the curriculum emphasises skills and values
essential for citizenship, shaping individuals who think critically, make
informed decisions, and act with empathy.</p>

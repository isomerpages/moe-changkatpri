### **Character &amp; Citizenship Education (CCE)**
#### **Department’s Vision: Citizens of Honour**
At Changkat Primary School, we believe that Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) is key in developing holistically-educated students. The school’s CCE vision, 'Citizens of Honour' is aligned to the school’s vision of 'Learners with Passion, Citizens of Honour'.

Taking reference from moral and social-emotional psychological theories on child and youth development, a set of CCE Developmental Milestones was developed by MOE. The CCE Developmental Milestones articulate indicators of development in character, social-emotional well-being and citizenship dispositions for our students. The three intents of the CCE Developmental Milestones are:


#### **Character and Citizenship Education Developmental Milestones**

|  |  |
|:---:|:---:|
| **Intent 1** | Develop self-awareness and self-management skills to achieve personal effectiveness and well-being. |
| **Intent 2** | Develop social awareness and manage relationships for personal and social well-being. |
| **Intent 3** | Make responsible decisions and act on them. |
|

The whole-school CCE implementation anchors on the R³ICH and PRIDE values, the Social and Emotional (SE) Competencies and the 21<sup>st</sup> Century Competencies. &nbsp;The SE competencies are skills necessary for students to recognise and manage emotions, develop care and concern for others, make responsible decisions, establish positive relationships, and handle challenging situations effectively. The competencies play a significant role in our students’ character development as they build a strong foundation in our students.

The 21<sup>st</sup> Century Competencies, which are Civic Literacy, Global Awareness and Cross-Cultural Skills, Critical and Inventive Thinking, and Communication, Collaboration and Information Skills, are necessary for the globalised world we live in. Together, these core values and competencies will help our students embody the Desired Outcomes of Education: to be a Self-directed Learner, an Active Contributor, a Concerned Citizen and a Confident Person, so that they are able to capitalise on the rich opportunities of the digital age, while keeping a strong Singapore heartbeat.

The school’s CCE programmes are delivered through the curriculum and co-curriculum to achieve the intended outcomes. The design and delivery of CCE as a total curriculum is guided by the 5Ps of CCE (**P**urpose, **P**upil, Holistic Ex**P**riences, **P**rofessional Development and **P**artnership). Through the E³ approach (**E**ducate, **E**xperience and **E**xcel), all students will be provided with opportunities to learn through experience and apply and reflect on what has been taught subsequently.

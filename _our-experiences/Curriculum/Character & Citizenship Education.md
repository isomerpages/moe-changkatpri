<h3><strong>Character &amp; Citizenship Education (CCE)</strong></h3>
<p><strong><br></strong>At Changkat Primary School, Character and Citizenship
Education (CCE) plays a vital role in nurturing students who are grounded
in values and prepared to thrive in an ever-changing world. Our CCE vision,
“Citizens of Honour,” aligns closely with the school vision of “Learners
with Passion, Citizens of Honour”, reflecting our belief that strong character
forms the foundation of meaningful learning and responsible citizenship.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Guided by established moral and socio-emotional developmental theories,
the Ministry of Education (MOE) has articulated a set of CCE Developmental
Milestones that outline progressive indicators of character growth, social-emotional
competencies, and citizenship dispositions for students. These milestones
serve to guide schools and families in supporting children’s holistic development.
<br><strong><br>The CCE developmental milestones are:<br><br></strong>

<br>Our whole-school CCE approach is grounded in MOE’s R³ICH values and our
school’s PRIDE values, Social and Emotional (SE) Competencies and emerging
21st Century Competencies. Figure 1 below shows the relationship between
the framework for 21<sup>st</sup> Century Competencies and Student Outcomes
and the CCE 2021 Curriculum. It clarifies how values and social-emotional
skills work together, and how students can put these values into practice.
For more information on the 21st Century Competencies, please visit the

<p>The school’s CCE programmes are delivered through both the curriculum
and co-curriculum to achieve the intended student outcomes. The design
and delivery of CCE as a whole-school curriculum are guided by the 5Ps
of CCE — Purpose, Pupil, Holistic Experiences, Professional Development,
and Partnership.</p>
<p>Using the E³ approach (Educate, Experience, Excel), students learn through
meaningful experiences and are given opportunities to apply and reflect
on what they have been taught.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are several learning platforms where CCE is enacted with intentionality.
These include CCE Lessons during curriculum time, planned student development
learning experiences beyond the classroom, teachable moments during other
subject lessons and learning opportunities beyond school.</p>

<p>For each of these programmes and activities, specific CCE learning outcomes
are articulated, and planned activities are incorporated with the intention
of realising the identified learning outcomes. These activities are based
on experiential learning pedagogy, including dialogue, discussion and reflection,
and intentional application of values, social-emotional, and civic competencies.</p>

<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>CCE is reinforced through school-based programmes too, designed for our
students’ needs, and through subjects like Social Studies, Science, Arts,
Languages and PE that help students explore values and real-world issues.
Students also learn during daily interactions and teachable moments, where
they practise respect, care and responsibility. Personal reflection and
authentic learning experiences further shape their character and guide
their growth.</p>

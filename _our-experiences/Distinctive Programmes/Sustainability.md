### **Sustainability**
**School Sustainability GoGreen Plan**

#### **Mission and Vision**

Changkat Primary’s School Sustainability GoGreen Programme builds on the MOE Eco Stewardship Programme, which focuses on the current environmental efforts in schools. This will be done holistically through the 4Cs:

* **Curriculum:** Enhance teaching and learning of sustainability in Science and Humanities, and integrate campus sustainability features into learning resources to make learning more authentic.

* **Campus:** Enhance campus with sustainability features like solar panels, LED lights and energy-efficient fans.
 
* **Culture:** Practise daily habits like reducing food waste and energy use, and encourage students to champion sound sustainability practices amongst peers.
 
* **Community:** Leverage community partnerships to offer students more environment-related learning opportunities, and better understanding of future “green jobs”.

#### **Programmes**
The school programmes are aligned to the 4Cs.

##### **1. Curriculum**
Our school’s ALP **(ECO@CKP)** offers focuses on the contextual theme of Sustainability. ECO@CKP is integrated into Project Work (PW) and tiered at 2 levels. At Tier 1, ALP-PW coding lessons are weaved into the curriculum at Primary 1 to Primary 5 levels. During the lessons, students learn coding using various coding platforms such as Awbie, Scratch and Micro:bits. During their PW journey, students are updated with the current environmental issues.

##### **2. Campus**
Our school regularly upgrades our school facilities and processes to reduce waste and promote green initiatives.

For e.g.,
* We have the food compost system to make compost for our – gardens
* Our butterfly trail and Science garden to promote greenery.
* Use of 4 ticks energy saving appliances such as our aircon.
* Settin of 24 Degree Celsius for air-conditioned rooms to prevent wastage of energy.
* Less paper waste with more parents on-board Parents’ gateway.
* Exploration of setting up vertical gardens in future to cool down our school building.

##### **3.Culture**
Our school taps on our CCE VIA programme to inculcate the culture of **3Rs – Reduce, Reuse and Recycle**.

A few examples are:
* Lessons on 3Rs take place during FTGP for P3.
* P5 upcycling programme
* P1-P6 recycling programme
* VIA leaders to promote green initiatives.
* P6 Social Enterprise Day, where students upcycle items into toys, art work and sell them to contribute to social causes.
* Food compost programme and Clean plate campaign to educate our students to reduce food waste.

##### **4.Community**
We partner with external organisations such as NEA, Terra and Science Centre, to create awareness of current sustainability issues that Singapore face.

For e.g.,
* R.I.S.E exhibition by Terra to create awareness on the rising water level in February 2022.
* Singapore World Water Day.
* Differentiated SLS lessons created for Singapore World Water Day with quizzes and activities.

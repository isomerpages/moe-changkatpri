<h3><strong>Modular Curricular Activities (MCA)</strong></h3>
<p>MCA are curricular periods set aside for Primary 3 to 6 students to learn
beyond the formal curriculum. They provide a platform for broad-based exposure
to different disciplines that are not typically covered in the regular
syllabus. We believe that expansive learning nurtures a love for learning
by shifting the focus from studying solely to pass examinations, towards
learning for self-improvement and the pursuit of knowledge.</p>
<p>MCA also provides opportunities to promote inter-disciplinary projects,
where students can apply knowledge and skills from different subject areas
in meaningful and authentic contexts.</p>
<p>Our Learning for Life Programme (LLP), Applied Learning Programme (ALP),
and Conversational Chinese and Malay (CCM) all make use of this platform
to curate unique and enriching experiences for our students. This ensures
that their time in Changkat is one that fosters a lifelong joy of learning.‚Äù</p>

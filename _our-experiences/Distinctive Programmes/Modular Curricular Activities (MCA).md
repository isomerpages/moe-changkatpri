### **Modular Curricular Activities (MCA)**
#### **Modular Curricular Activities (MCA)**
MCA are curricular periods set aside for Primary 3 to 6 students to learn beyond the formal curriculum. They provide a platform for broad-based exposure to different disciplines that are not typically covered in the regular syllabus. We believe that expansive learning nurtures a love for learning by shifting the focus from studying solely to pass examinations, towards learning for self-improvement and the pursuit of knowledge.

MCA also provides opportunities to promote inter-disciplinary projects, where students can apply knowledge and skills from different subject areas in meaningful and authentic contexts.

Our Learning for Life Programme (LLP), Applied Learning Programme (ALP), and Conversational Chinese and Malay (CCM) all make use of this platform to curate unique and enriching experiences for our students. This ensures that their time in Changkat is one that fosters a lifelong joy of learning.‚Äù

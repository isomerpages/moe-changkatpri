### **Applied Learning Programme (ALP)**
#### **Vision and mission of ECO@CKP Applied Learning Programme**

In 2019, we introduced our Applied Learning Programme (ALP). ALP has a&nbsp;**E3 approach - Engage, Enrich and Empower**&nbsp;\- to cultivate a joy of learning in our students. With the theme&nbsp;**ECO@CKP**, it seeks to have our students be:

*   **E**mpathetic towards our&nbsp;**E**arth and environment
*   Skillful in&nbsp;**C**omputational thinking with development of&nbsp;**C**oding skills
*   **O**pportunity seekers (through Design Thinking)

Its emphasis is on hands-on learning and experiments, solving real-life problems related to our Earth and Environment in our everyday lives.

Students will then apply these skills they learnt in the implementation of their&nbsp;**Project Work (PW),**&nbsp;which is the&nbsp;**end-product of the ALP**.

We believe in a spiral approach where students will revisit the same topics every year, with each encounter increasing in complexity and reinforcing previous learning.

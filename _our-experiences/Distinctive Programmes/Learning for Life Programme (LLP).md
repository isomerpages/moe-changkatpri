### **Learning for Life Programme (LLP)**

At Changkat Primary, we believe learning goes beyond books and classrooms. Our **Learning for Life Programme (LLP)**, known as **SOAR@CKP** (Sports, Outdoor, Athletics & Recreation @ Changkat Primary), provides our students with meaningful opportunities for experimentation, self-discovery, and the joy of learning through sports and the outdoors.

* * *

**Our Aims**

Through SOAR@CKP, we aim to:

*   Nurture a love for sports, outdoor activities, and sustainable living that lasts a lifetime.
*   Build character, teamwork, and responsibility while promoting **inclusivity, social integration, and racial harmony**.
*   Provide opportunities for every child to participate meaningfully, regardless of ability or readiness.
*   Develop student leadership through participation, service, and community outreach.
*   Establish our school as a champion and advocate for sports, outdoor education, and inclusive practices in the community.

* * *

**Growing with the Times**

Since 2024, SOAR@CKP has continued to anchor itself in these goals while also **pivoting towards inclusivity and sustainability**. We have introduced sports that broaden horizons and ensure everyone can play a part, such as **cycling, Paralympic volleyball, and goalball**. These new avenues celebrate diversity and encourage our students to see sports as a way to bring people together and to care for the environment.

**Programmes in Action**

SOAR@CKP brings fun and accessible sporting opportunities to every level through our **Inter-Class Games (ICG)**. Each year group experiences a sport designed with differentiated rules and modified equipment, so every child – regardless of readiness – can join in:

*   **P1**: Kampong Cricket
*   **P2**: Modified Volleyball
*   **P3**: Captain’s Ball
*   **P4**: Modified Handball
*   **P5**: Modified 3-on-3 Basketball
*   **P6**: Modified Tchoukball

In **Outdoor Education**, our students explore the world beyond school in age-appropriate, confidence-building ways:

*   **P1**: Neighbourhood Playground Programme and Learning Journey to Pasir Ris Park
*   **P2**: Learning Journey to HortPark
*   **P3**: Pilot Virtual Orienteering (to be rolled out fully in 2026)
*   **P4**: _Coming in 2026_ – a **one-night Outdoor Camp** to build resilience and camaraderie
*   **P6**: Expedition Cycling

* * *

**Looking Ahead**

As we grow, SOAR@CKP grows with us. By 2026, students can look forward to:

*   The launch of the **P4 Outdoor Camp**, an overnight adventure to build resilience, teamwork, and independence.
*   The full roll-out of the **Virtual Outdoor Education Orienteering Programme** for P3.
*   Continued emphasis on **inclusive and sustainable sports**, ensuring every child can discover their strengths while learning to care for the community and the environment.

At Changkat, **SOAR@CKP is more than a programme – it is a spirit.**  
We play, we explore, and we grow together, all while discovering the joy of sports, the outdoors, and a sustainable way of life.

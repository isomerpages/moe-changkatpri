<h3><strong>Learning for Life Programme (LLP)</strong></h3>
<p>At Changkat Primary, we believe learning goes beyond books and classrooms.
Our <strong>Learning for Life Programme (LLP)</strong>, known as <strong>SOAR@CKP</strong> (Sports,
Outdoor, Athletics &amp; Recreation @ Changkat Primary), provides our students
with meaningful opportunities for experimentation, self-discovery, and
the joy of learning through sports and the outdoors.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Our Aims</strong>
</p>
<p>Through SOAR@CKP, we aim to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Nurture a love for sports, outdoor activities, and sustainable living
that lasts a lifetime.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build character, teamwork, and responsibility while promoting <strong>inclusivity, social integration, and racial harmony</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide opportunities for every child to participate meaningfully, regardless
of ability or readiness.</p>

outreach.</p>
</li>

<hr>
<p><strong>Growing with the Times</strong>
</p>
<p>Since 2024, SOAR@CKP has continued to anchor itself in these goals while
also <strong>pivoting towards inclusivity and sustainability</strong>. We
have introduced sports that broaden horizons and ensure everyone can play
a part, such as <strong>cycling, Paralympic volleyball, and goalball</strong>.
These new avenues celebrate diversity and encourage our students to see
sports as a way to bring people together and to care for the environment.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Programmes in Action</strong>
</p>
<p>SOAR@CKP brings fun and accessible sporting opportunities to every level
through our <strong>Inter-Class Games (ICG)</strong>. Each year group experiences
a sport designed with differentiated rules and modified equipment, so every
child – regardless of readiness – can join in:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>P1</strong>: Kampong Cricket</p>

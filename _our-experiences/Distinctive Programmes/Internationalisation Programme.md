<p><strong>Key International Programmes and Activities&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Overseas cultural programme with Beijing PeiXin Primary School</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Changkat Primary School has enjoyed a long-standing partnership with Beijing
Peixin Primary School as part of our commitment to nurturing global awareness
in our students—helping them to be sensitive to and appreciative of diverse
cultures and backgrounds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, our schools stayed connected through virtual
exchanges. With the resumption of safe travel, we were delighted to host
students from Beijing Peixin Primary School in Singapore for a meaningful
four-day cultural exchange.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Our Primary 5 and Primary 6 students served as buddies to the visiting
students, extending a warm welcome and engaging in shared learning experiences
both in the classroom and through various activities. The interactions
between the PeiXin and Changkat students were meaningful, as they not only
learned together but also built friendships, enhanced their social skills,
and deepened their cultural awareness.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overseas Cultural Exchange Programme with Prayaprasert School</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We hosted Prayaprasert School, Thailand as part of our efforts in understanding
our ASEAN neighbours. Primary 4 Class Leaders welcomed their Thai friends
by putting up a performance, bringing them for recess and partnering them
during lessons. The buddies then had a wonderful lunch of local delights
and exchanged cards and gifts before saying farewell. Through these interactions,
our Changkat students picked up global literacy skills and awareness on
how to communicate and collaborate with their ASEAN peers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Immersion Programme between Sekolah Putrajaya Presint 11(1) and Changkat Primary School</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 2024 Immersion Programme between Sekolah Putrajaya Presint 11(1) and
Changkat Primary School provided students with rich cross-cultural learning
experiences. The day began with a warm welcome and pairing of buddies,
followed by engaging classroom lessons, including an introduction to khat
writing. Students bonded further during recess through ice-breaker activities
and a school tour, fostering friendships across borders. The highlight
of the programme was a vibrant cultural showcase, featuring Dikir Barat
and choral singing, which celebrated the beauty of cultural diversity.
The day concluded with an exchange of gifts and heartfelt farewells, leaving
lasting memories of collaboration, learning, and friendship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our visitors sat in our lessons to learn what a typical day is like. Our
CKPS students had to guide them along, ensuring cross-cultural exchanges
between both parties.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>International Friendship Day 2025: ‘Singapore: Forging Friendships in a Complex World’</strong> &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our school commemorated <strong>International Friendship Day (IFD) on Thu 10 Apr</strong> which
was dedicated to help our students deepen their understanding of Singapore’s
relations with neighbouring countries and beyond. Through the commemoration
of IFD, we hope our students will be sensitised to Singapore’s geopolitical
realities and to reflect on the importance of: &nbsp;
<br> &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>an active foreign policy to maintain Singapore’s international space; &nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>openness to the international flow of trade, ideas and talent;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>cross-cultural skills and a global orientation; and  &nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the spirit of friendship and collaboration amongst different people.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The theme for this year’s IFD, ‘<strong>Singapore: Forging Friendships in a Complex World</strong>’
emphasises that international cooperation remains vital for us to address
global issues collectively and seize new opportunities. By fostering an
appreciation of different cultures and perspectives, students will be better
equipped to contribute to a cohesive and globally connected society. Our
students can then forge meaningful connections with our neighbours and
help Singapore to remain relevant in a complex world. In addition, they
can embrace openness and opportunities for international cooperation, while
deepening their understanding of Singapore’s geopolitical realities and
national interests. &nbsp;</p>

Changkat were invited to the stage with their parents to share about the

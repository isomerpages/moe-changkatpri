<h3><strong>Applied Learning Programme (ALP)</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Vision and mission of ECO@CKP Applied Learning Programme</strong></h4>

<p>In nurturing our students to become <strong>Learners with Passion, Citizens of Honour</strong>,
we believe that when our students learn and acquire knowledge, it not only
enriches their own lives but also influences those around them and positively
impacts their communities. With that belief, our school’s Applied Learning
Programme (ALP), <strong>ECO@CKP</strong>, aims to nurture students as
eco-stewards who care for the environment, advocate sustainable habits,
and <strong>solve environmental challenges with their computational skills</strong>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Initiated in 2019, ECO@CKP integrates <strong>design thinking into environmental education</strong> where
students develop practical solutions to environmental problems with technology
and cultivate <strong>emerging</strong>  <strong>21<sup>st</sup> century skills</strong> such
as critical thinking and adaptability in students. They learn to approach
complex problems with creativity, empathy, and resilience, empowering them
to become effective problem solvers in the pursuit of a more sustainable
future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Students will then apply these skills they learnt in the implementation
of their <strong>Project Work (PW),</strong> which is the <strong>end-product of the ALP</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We believe in a spiral approach where students will revisit the same topics
every year, with each encounter increasing in complexity and reinforcing
previous learning.&nbsp;</p>

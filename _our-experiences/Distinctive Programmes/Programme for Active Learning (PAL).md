PAL is an initiative introduced at the lower primary (P1 & P2) to ensure that our young are equipped not just with content knowledge but also with the necessary skills and values to thrive in the globalised future. The programme offers a learning experience that is active, hands-on and meaningful. Through this, students develop their confidence, curiosity and cooperation skills.

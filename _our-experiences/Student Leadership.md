<h3><strong>Student Leadership</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Aim</strong></h4>
<p>In CKPS, we believe that every student has the potential to be a leader.
We aim to develop student leaders to be Citizens of Honour who lead by
serving and caring for others. Guided by the principles of Servant Leadership,
our Student Leadership Programme is aligned with our school values, vision
and mission to support the development of potential in students.</p>

<h5><strong>1. Model the Way (Accountability)</strong></h5>
<p>Student Leaders are expected to lead by example and be good role models.
They will exemplify our school values through their actions and influence
others to act and follow in being a citizen of honour.</p>
<h5><strong>2. Inspire a Shared Vision (Effective Collaboration)</strong></h5>
<p>Equipped with effective communication skills, the Student Leaders share
their ideas with passion and rally others to strive towards a common vision.</p>
<h5><strong>3. Challenge the Process (Courage)</strong></h5>
<p>Student Leaders search for challenging opportunities to adapt, grow, and
invent in their efforts to improve the school experience for all.</p>
<h5><strong>4. Enable Others to Act (Respect)</strong></h5>
<p>Student Leaders thrive as team players, fostering collaboration through
building trust and facilitating relationships.</p>
<h5><strong>5. Encourage the Heart (Humility)</strong></h5>
<p>Student Leaders recognise and appreciate the contributions made by their
team members through affirmation, encouragement and showing moral support.
They make the conscious effort to celebrate milestones to build a strong
sense of collective identity and community spirit.</p>

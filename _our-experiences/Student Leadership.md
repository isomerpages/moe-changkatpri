##### **1. Model the Way (Accountability)**
Student Leaders are expected to lead by example and be good role models. They will exemplify our school values through their actions and influence others to act and follow in being a citizen of honour.

##### **2. Inspire a Shared Vision (Effective Collaboration)**
Equipped with effective communication skills, the Student Leaders share their ideas with passion and rally others to strive towards a common vision.

##### **3. Challenge the Process (Courage)**
Student Leaders search for challenging opportunities to adapt, grow, and invent in their efforts to improve the school experience for all.

##### **4. Enable Others to Act (Respect)**
Student Leaders thrive as team players, fostering collaboration through building trust and facilitating relationships.

##### **5. Encourage the Heart (Humility)**
Student Leaders recognise and appreciate the contributions made by their team members through affirmation, encouragement and showing moral support. They make the conscious effort to celebrate milestones to build a strong sense of collective identity and community spirit.

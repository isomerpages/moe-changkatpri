## Parents Gateway

Parents Gateway is a mobile application (or "app") that supports parents and schools on key administrative matters, providing MOE and schools with the platform to send updates on programmes and activities to parents. At the same time, Parents Gateway allows parents to perform administrative functions such as providing consent for their children to participate in school activities and declaring travel plans.

It aims to aggregate parent-teacher communications securely on a centralised digital platform.

Access to Parents Gateway is given to parents, legal guardians and authorised caregivers of students currently studying in MOE schools. Parents with children eligible for P1 registration will be able to access Parents Gateway from late May 2021 as well. Parents will need to use their Singpass to access Parents Gateway.

Download and install the app via [App](https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/parents-gateway/id1267198708?platform=iphone) Store (for iPhones) or [Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.moe.pgp) Store (for Android phones).

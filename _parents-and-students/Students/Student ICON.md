Student ICON login details has been given to students.

For the ICON email address, please take note the following:
*   Any space in the full name will be replaced with an underscore.
*   Should the student’s full name have words such as “Bte”, “d/o”  and “s/o”, they will not appear in the email address. (eg, Abdullah Bte Mohmand => abdullah\_mohmand@students.edu.sg
*   For cases where students share the same full name, we have added a numerical number (e.g. Ang\_Bee\_Bee\_1, Ang\_Bee\_Bee\_2) to differentiate their email addresses.
*   Take note of the correct domain is student**S**.edu.sg not ~student.edu.sg~

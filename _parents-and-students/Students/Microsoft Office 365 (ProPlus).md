### **Microsoft Office 365 (ProPlus)**
Dear Students,  
  
As part of the MOE-Microsoft Student Use Benefits, students can use their **MIMS (Student iCON)** accounts to download **Office Applications** such as **Excel, PowerPoint, Word**, etc.  
  
This access is **free** for students whose parents have given their consent to MOE's centrally provisioned digital tools.  
  
**Office.com online services (eg. OneDrive, Teams etc) are not available** at this phase of deployment. More details will be shared at a later date when the services become available.  
  
**Office 365 ProPlus** is a suite of productivity tools (including full version of Excel, PowerPoint & Word) that is installed on your **personal desktop, laptop or mobile device and Personal Learning Device** (PLD).

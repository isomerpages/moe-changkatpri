<p>At Changkat Primary School (CKPS), we are guided by our steadfast commitment
&nbsp;to be the school of choice in our community by providing every CKPian
with a quality, holistic education that develops both passionate learners
and grounded in values.</p>
<p>Anchored by our school vision, <strong><em>Learners with Passion, Citizens of Honour</em></strong>,
we focus on purposeful and meaningful learning experiences that nurture
curiosity, resilience and &nbsp;a love for learning , Our curriculum and
programmes are thoughtfully aligned to MOE’s emphasis on holistic development,
values education, and the development of 21st Century Competencies, ensuring
that our students are well-prepared to thrive in school and beyond. Coined
as our ‘<strong>The Changkat Experience’</strong>, our signature programmes
reflect this commitment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>SOAR @ CKPS</strong> provides students with rich opportunities
to engage in a wide range of sports and outdoor activities, strengthening
teamwork, leadership, resilience, and perseverance.</p>
<p><strong>ECO@ CKPS</strong> nurtures our students to become environmentally
responsible citizens who care for the planet, practise sustainable habits,
and actively contribute to solving environmental challenges, in line with
global sustainability efforts.</p>
<p>Our <strong>Modular Co-curricular programme</strong> provides our students
with broad-based learning experiences that develop the <strong>21<sup>st</sup> Century Competencies</strong>,
while fostering values, leadership skills, and a sense of responsibility.</p>
<p>The <strong>Home Class System</strong> further supports character development
by fostering an inclusive and diverse learning environment, encouraging
mutual respect, and empathy among students.</p>
<p>At the heart of all that we do is the shaping of strong character, grounded
by our <strong>PRIDE values – Patriotism, Resilience, Integrity, Discipline, and Empathy</strong>.
These values are intentionally and consistently lived out through both
work and play, within and beyond the classroom. Through these authentic
learning &nbsp;experiences, we prepare our students to contribute positively
to their communities and to lead with confidence, compassion, and purpose.</p>
<p>Behind every child at CKPS, there is a group of dedicated teachers who
play a critical role in your child’s development. Our teachers are also
deeply committed to professional excellence and continuous improvement.
Through reflective practice, strong partnerships with parents, and a shared
focus on student well-being and achievement, we strive to create a safe,
engaging, and inspiring learning environment for our CKPians.</p>
<p>Rooted in a proud history that dates back to our nation’s independence,
our school stands as a symbol of excellence, resilience, and progress.
Generations of students have walked our halls, leaving as young people
of character, purpose, and leadership. &nbsp;We honour our past while continually
evolving to meet the needs of today’s learners.</p>
<p>We look forward to partnering you closely in your child’s educational
journey at CKPS. Together, we prepare our students- &nbsp;‘<strong>To Learn, To Live, To Serve’.</strong>

<h3><strong>History</strong></h3>
<p>Founded in 1965, Changkat Primary School was originally named Changkat
Changi Primary School due to its location atop a small hill ("changkat"
meaning small hill in Malay) at 10 Milestone Changi Road.</p>
<p>In 1988, the school moved to Simei Street 3 and was renamed Changkat Primary
School. In 2002, the school went through PRIME upgrading and had to move
to a temporary holding site located at No.7, Jalan Tiga Ratus. In June
2004, Changkat Primary moved back to its present premise.</p>
<p>Over the years, Changkat Primary School has grown strength to strength
to become a well- established school in the east of Singapore. Changkat
Primary students do well under the care and guidance of the caring teachers
and staff. They do well in both academic and non-academic areas such as
Sports and Games, Aesthetics, and Information Communication Technology
(ICT).

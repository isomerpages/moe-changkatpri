### Applied Learning Programme (ALP)

In 2019, we introduced our **Applied Learning Programme (ALP)**. ALP has a E3 approach - Engage, Enrich and Empower - to cultivate a joy of learning in our students. With the theme ECO@CKP, it seeks to have our students be:

*  **E**mpathetic towards our Earth and Environment
*  Skilful in **C**omputational thinking with development of **C**oding skills
*  **O**pportunity seekers (through Design Thinking)

Its emphasis is on hands-on learning and experiments, solving real-life problems related to our Earth and Environment in our everyday lives.

Do watch the following video on our school’s ALP: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoP6IrzAvic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoP6IrzAvic)

Students will then apply these skills they learnt in the implementation of their **Project Work (PW)**, which is the end product of the ALP.

We believe in a spiral approach where students will revisit the same topics every year, with each encounter increasing in complexity and reinforcing previous learning.

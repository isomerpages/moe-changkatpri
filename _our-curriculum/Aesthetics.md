#### ART@Changkat

The teaching of Art in Changkat Primary is guided by the 3E framework of ‘Educate, Experience & Excel’. At the level of “Educate and Experience”, students are introduced to different art forms through a holistic and interdisciplinary approach. They explore and experiment different materials and processes, themes and meanings to foster creative thinking. Since Art is the quality of being human, learning is made relevant through contextualising of visual art. While developing perceptual sensitivity to their world, there will be opportunity for growth and understanding of the self and of others. Armed with the ability to create new knowledge, students can appreciate the processes and thinking that are involved in art making. At the level of “Excel”, students are strongly encouraged to participate in various external art competitions such as Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Art Exhibition.

#### MUSIC@Changkat

The teaching of Music in Changkat Primary is guided by the 3E framework of ‘**Educate, Experience & Excel**’. At the level of “Educate and Experience”, the focus is on cultivating and developing students’ skills and knowledge by providing them with direct experiences in the components of ‘Listening’ and ‘Music-Making’. Within these two components, a variety of content, skills and values are covered. In addition students create and improvise rhythmic and melodic phrases as well as sound effects. They are guided to notate their compositions in conventional and non-conventional forms for performances. 21st century competencies will be taught through the infusion of ICT into Music lessons with the use of computer software and iPad applications in Music creation for selected levels. At the level of “Excel”, students are actively encouraged to participate in various internal and external music competitions and performances such as ‘Watch Me’ and ‘Changkat’s Got Talent’ as well as show their patriotism to their class by actively participating in music activities during school events and celebrations.

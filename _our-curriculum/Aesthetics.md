#### ART@Changkat

The teaching of Art in Changkat Primary is guided by the 3E framework of ‘Educate, Experience & Excel’. At the level of “Educate and Experience”, students are introduced to different art forms through a holistic and interdisciplinary approach. They explore and experiment different materials and processes, themes and meanings to foster creative thinking. Since Art is the quality of being human, learning is made relevant through contextualising of visual art. While developing perceptual sensitivity to their world, there will be opportunity for growth and understanding of the self and of others. Armed with the ability to create new knowledge, students can appreciate the processes and thinking that are involved in art making. At the level of “Excel”, students are strongly encouraged to participate in various external art competitions such as Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Art Exhibition.

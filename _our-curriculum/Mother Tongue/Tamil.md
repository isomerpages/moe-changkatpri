### Tamil

#### Tamil Programmes and Activities

Tamil Department organizes programmes and activities for the pupils so that they can be linguistically competent and confident in using the Tamil Language.  These activities enable them to explore and understand the tradition and values embedded in the Indian culture.  

Do enjoy watching this video clip to see how our pupils learn and use Tamil, over and beyond our classroom activities. <br>

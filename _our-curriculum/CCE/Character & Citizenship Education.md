### Character & Citizenship Education

#### Department’s Vision: Citizens of Honour
At Changkat Primary School, we believe that Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) is key in developing holistically-educated students. The school’s CCE vision, ‘Citizens of Honour’, is aligned to the school’s vision of ‘Learners with Passion, Citizens of Honour’.

The CCE Learning Outcomes (LOs) state what we want our students to learn and attain. The CCE core values are embedded in the eight LOs. LOs 1 to 4 depict different aspects of character building that are interrelated and feature social and emotional competencies. LOs 5 to 8 are guided by key tenets of 21st Century citizenship and arranged according to attributes of citizenship such as identity, culture, and active, responsible engagement as a member of society.

|  | Character and Citizenship Education Learning Outcomes |
|---|---|
| LO1 | Acquire self-awareness and apply self-management skills to achieve personal well-being and effectiveness. |
| LO2 | Act with integrity and make responsible decisions that uphold moral principles. |
| LO3 | Acquire social awareness and apply interpersonal skills to build and maintain positive relationships based on mutual respect. |
| LO4 | Be resilient and have the ability to turn challenges into opportunities. |
| LO5 | Take pride in our national identity, have a sense of belonging to Singapore and be committed to nation building. |
| LO6 | Value Singapore’s socio-cultural diversity, and promote social cohesion and harmony. |
| LO7 | Care for others and contribute actively to the progress of our community and nation. |
| LO8 | Reflect on and respond to community, national and global issues, as an informed and responsible citizen. |
|

The whole-school CCE implementation anchors on the R³ICH and PRIDE values, the Social and Emotional (SE) Competencies and the 21st Century Competencies.  The SE competencies are skills necessary for students to recognise and manage emotions, develop care and concern for others, make responsible decisions, establish positive relationships, and handle challenging situations effectively. The competencies play a significant role in our students’ character development as they build a strong foundation in our students.

The 21st Century Competencies, which are Civic Literacy, Global Awareness and Cross-Cultural Skills, Critical and Inventive Thinking, and Communication, Collaboration and Information Skills, are necessary for the globalised world we live in. Together, these core values and competencies will help our students embody the Desired Outcomes of Education: to be a Self-directed Learner, an Active Contributor, a Concerned Citizen and a Confident Person, so that they are able to capitalise on the rich opportunities of the digital age, while keeping a strong Singapore heartbeat.

The school’s CCE programmes are delivered through the curriculum and co-curriculum to achieve the intended outcomes. The design and delivery of CCE as a total curriculum is guided by the 5Ps of CCE (Purpose, Pupil, Holistic ExPeriences, Professional Development and Partnership). Through the E³ approach (Educate, Experience and Excel), all students will be provided with opportunities to learn through experience and apply and reflect on what has been taught subsequently.

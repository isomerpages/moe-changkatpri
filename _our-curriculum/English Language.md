A typical English language classroom at both the lower and middle primaries is filled with bursts of colours from classrooms displays, mostly handiworks of our enthusiastic language learners and of thoughtful chatter of the pupils. The vibrancy in colours and of the pupils’ conversations is mainly due to the implementation of STELLAR.

##### Writing, Reading & Oral Communication
We believe in equipping our language learners with a host of strategies to tackle various components of the English Language.

Our writing packages, which begin with the Middle Primary (P3 & P4) through to the Upper Primary (P5 & P6), teach pupils to write using an array of skills to connect with the readers. Strategies are taught in equipping our pupils with the skills to plan their story, work on plot development and strengthen the use of language skills when creating a masterpiece. At the Lower Primary (P1 & P2), the pupils learn to put magic into their writing through a simpler structure.

There are many reading strategies when it comes to interacting with a text. In CKPS, pupils are taught to be more deliberate readers; one who is able to connect with the text, the world and self. They do so through effective reading comprehension skills like annotation. Pupils learn to stop to ask questions as they read texts so as to glean a better understanding of what the author is putting across. This in turn aids pupils in answering comprehension questions better. In tackling the Oral Communication component, pupils use the EEC strategy in order to Express, Elaborate and Conclude a given stimulus presented in Stimulus-based Conversation component.

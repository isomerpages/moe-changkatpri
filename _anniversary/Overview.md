<p>Changkat Primary School will be celebrating our 60th Anniversary on 5
July 2025. This milestone event, themed “Changkat Experience (Special Edition)
– Then, Now &amp; Beyond”, seeks to unite our cherished community of past
and present students, staff, and stakeholders in a meaningful celebration.</p>
<p>To create a meaningful Changkat Kampong Spirit experience for students
and staff, the celebration focuses on three key aspects: reminiscing the
past, celebrating the present, and creating the future.</p>
<p>To help the community connect with the rich heritage of the Changkat kampong
spirit, visitors will get to go through experiences of the past which include
using old-school blue notebooks for mental arithmetic in a Mathematics
lesson and re-enacting Singapore traditional games in an outdoor lesson.</p>
<p>As part of our celebration of the present, our Primary 6 students will
spearhead the Social Enterprise Day (SED), an entrepreneurial initiative
that promotes sustainability. Visitors can enjoy engaging game stations
and purchase upcycled products and preloved items. This initiative aligns
with our school’s vision of nurturing Learners with Passion and Citizens
of Honour, focusing on service before self and fostering care for the community
and country. This experience showcases the enduring Changkat kampong spirit,
fostering a lasting legacy of unity and belonging for future generations.</p>
<p>As part of our celebrations and vision for a sustainable future, we are
proud to present SustainaTrail@Changkat-Simei—a community sustainability
trail that showcases the collective efforts of schools and organisations
in the neighbourhood to raise awareness on and promote sustainable living.
Designed to engage both residents and students, the trail aims to inspire
individuals to embrace sustainability in their daily lives. The trail is
open to the public, with participation capped at 80 individuals across
various age groups.</p>

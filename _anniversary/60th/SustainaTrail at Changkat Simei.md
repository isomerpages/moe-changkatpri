<p>ðŸŒ¿ Discover SustainaTrail@Changkat-Simei ðŸŒ¿</p>
<p>An inspiring journey towards a greener future with SustainaTrail@Changkat-Simei
â€” a community sustainability trail that brings together the efforts of
neighbourhood schools and organisations committed to eco-friendly living.</p>
<p>Changkat Primary School was served as the official launch site of the
trail on 5 July 2025. Through showcasing both the schoolâ€™s and the communityâ€™s
sustainability initiatives, the trail aims to raise awareness and inspire
individuals and groups to take meaningful action in building a greener
Simei and Singapore.</p>
<p>Participants embarked on a walking trail that features various sustainability-themed
stations and venues located around the Simei neighbourhood, including Farm@116
and Changi Simei Community Club. These stops provide hands-on experiences
and practical ideas to make sustainability part of everyday life.</p>
<p>Adding to the excitement, schools in Simei had also set up interactive
booths to share their eco-initiatives and encourage environmental stewardship
across the community.</p>
<p>Come explore, learn, and be inspired to take action â€” one green step at
a time</p>
<p>This walking trail offers engaging experiences and practical ideas that
encourage participants of all ages to make sustainability a part of their
daily lives.

<p>ðŸ‘£ Walk the trail. Be inspired. Make a change.</p>

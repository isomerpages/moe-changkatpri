<p>Changkat Goes Purple is our vibrant annual initiative, inspired by the
spirit of Singapore’s Purple Parade. It’s our way of educating and empowering
the Changkat family to embrace tolerance and build a truly inclusive community.</p>
<p>Join us at the Changkat Goes Purple booth during our 60th Anniversary
celebrations and dive into the inspiring work of our passionate Case Management
Team. Discover how our dedicated SENOs champion and support students with
special needs through close collaboration and heartfelt care.</p>
<p>Learn about our strong partnerships with external stakeholders, working
hand-in-hand with families to create a nurturing environment for every
child. Plus, don’t miss our quiet, immersive activity that lets you step
into the shoes of a student with needs—an experience that’s both eye-opening
and deeply moving.</p>
<p>Together, we celebrate inclusion, understanding, and the beautiful journey
toward a truly welcoming community!</p>

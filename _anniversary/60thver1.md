<h3><strong>OVERVIEW - 1st cut</strong></h3>
<p>Changkat Primary School will be celebrating our 60th Anniversary on 5
July 2025. This milestone event, themed “Changkat Experience (Special Edition)
– Then, Now &amp; Beyond”, seeks to unite our cherished community of past
and present students, staff, and stakeholders in a meaningful celebration.</p>
<p>To create a meaningful Changkat Kampong Spirit experience for students
and staff, the celebration focuses on three key aspects: Reminiscing the
past, Celebrating the present, and creating the future.</p>
<p>To help the community connect with the rich heritage of the Changkat Kampong
Spirit, participants will get to go through experiences of the past which
include using old school blue notebooks for mental arithmetic in a Mathematics
lesson and re-enacting Singapore traditional games in an outdoor lesson.</p>
<p>As part of our celebration of the present, our Primary 6 students will
spearhead the Social Enterprise Day (SED), an entrepreneurial initiative
that includes sales and game booths. Visitors can enjoy engaging game stations
and purchase upcycled products and preloved items, promoting sustainability.
This aligns with our school’s vision of nurturing Learners with Passion
and Citizens of Honour, focusing on service before self and fostering care
for the community and country. These experiences showcase the enduring
Changkat Kampong Spirit, fostering a lasting legacy of unity and belonging
for future generations.</p>
<p>As part of the festivities and our vision for the future, we are excited
to showcase SustainaTrail@Changkat-Simei, a community sustainability trail
that highlights the efforts of local schools and organizations in promoting
sustainable living. This trail will engage residents and students, inspiring
them to incorporate sustainability into their daily lives. The trail is
open to the public, with a maximum of 80 participants from various age
groups.</p>
